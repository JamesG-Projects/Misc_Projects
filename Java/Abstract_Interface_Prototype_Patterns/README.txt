The purpose of this project was to practice using different class types in a practical manner.
The code reads from a list of people's names, addresses, and zipcodes.
It then determines if the zipcodes are valid for a person's respective state by comparing to a dictionary of states and their associated zipcode range.
Then it determines what "color" a person's state is (Red or Blue, Republican or Democrat) based off another dictionary.
This project utilizes various java concepts, including: singleton class, abstract class, interface, and prototype.
